I am a full-stack developer currently working at a company, with a background in frontend development and a strong foundation in the MERN stack. I previously interned as a frontend developer using Next.js, and I’m highly skilled in React.js, Next.js, Firebase Auth, TypeScript, Redux, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Experienced in WordPress and Shopify CMS. With a solid understanding of REST API implementation and full-stack development, I collaborate effectively with backend teams and handle both frontend and backend tasks with confidence. I have extensive experience working with APIs and implementing robust authentication and authorization systems. React is my primary frontend framework, and I’m proficient in using Firebase not only for authentication but also as a real-time backend solution. I enjoy problem-solving, debugging, and continuously building scalable, user-focused web applications.
